# Phase I — Step 4: README, CLAUDE.md, validation

## Scope

Document setup and run instructions; provide Claude Code instructions for the project; confirm Phase I acceptance criteria.

## Spec references (source of truth)

- Constitution; Phase I deliverables (README, CLAUDE.md).
- Spec-Kit Plus expectations for project docs.

## Artifacts produced

- `README.md` with setup (UV install, run instructions).
- `CLAUDE.md` with Claude Code instructions for the project.
- Any run script or usage examples needed for judges.

## Key decisions

- README enables a new contributor to run the console app without writing code.
- CLAUDE.md directs Claude Code to specs and project conventions.

## Validation performed

- Follow README from clean clone → app runs; add/list/update/delete/complete work end-to-end.

## Provenance

Step completed spec-first using Claude Code; documentation refined until Phase I deliverables were complete.
